There's no argument for the state of matter, so you should suffer, it just makes sense
There's no argument to keep the universal clock, so let the time stop, it just makes sense

That's what the universe keeps telling me, oh oh
I don't know why, the universe's laws don't even apply

Why did this happen to me
Why am I the one
Why am I the one
Why am I the one

There's no argument for the state of matter, so you should suffer, it just makes sense
There's no argument to keep the universal clock, so let the time stop, it just makes sense

Mr. Universe, that doesn't make any sense, I don't think that it does to anyone but you
Mr. Universe, don't destroy your laws, I don't think that this action even has a justifiable cause
Mr. Universe, stop this immediately
All of us are suffering, which includes the ones who don't deserve it
Help me, help me, help me, help me

We're going in

Okay, man, you want to know something
You don't make me laugh
Go do something stupid, like become part of McDonald's staff

There you'll serve burgers to people of lower class
While everybody else is out there behind that precious glass

Because of something,
and something,
and something,
and something,
and something else

I might be saying something
Until all hell's

Broke loose, I'm a hacker (Wooh!)
To introduce, I'm a rapper
When I write, I'm an author (Ye)
When I film, I'm director

You don't know how long it's been
(Actually, it hasn't even been very long, not gonna lie)
I can't even begin
(What do you mean? I can begin, I can start talking about all kinds of things)
With this song, I will win
(Nah, I'll prob'ly lose)
And with this command, I'm in

What is that supposed to mean?
It's not like I'm a hacker or anything
What do you mean, I'm yapping too loud and you can't hear the song?
I'm not yapping at all; in fact, I'm being perfectly silent
You can just hear the song just fine
It's not like I'm yelling over it or something-AAAAA

I'm in

Everybody's talking about this one little thing that
Apparently, it makes your enemies go splat

I don't believe it, but I'm open to suggestion
Something that answers the question in question

What am I even talking about?
I'm just tryna rhyme, but I'm really just yappin'
It's like we just got out of a drought
And I'm just hoping it's never gonna happen again

Uh, what am I saying?
Is there a message I'm portraying?
Is there someone I'm betraying?
Because it sure seems like that everything is decaying (We're going in)

So, the song's basically over now; you can stop listening
There's nothing else, really, so just go 'head and stop listening
Turn off your phone, or listen to something else
I don't know, I don't care
This song is basically over now, you know

Well, what are you doing?
Go get ahead and stop listening to this song, seriously
There's nothing more to listen to; it's over
Seriously, literally, there's nothing more in this song
Why are you- why are you still listening
Get off
Look, even the background stuff stopped; it's just me talking
The song is over, stop listening

Okay, do I have to make you? Song, over.

I'm drowning in the spit!
I'm drowning in the spit

No one can help me, I'm drowning in the spit

I was drooling when I realized, I left my shrinking machine on
Too late that I realized, and I was left at small size
I was inside my own spit, swimming around desperately for help
But it was no use, I started drowning in my own spit

I'm drowning in the spit!

            lyrics: `
First you're reading a book and now you're
Asking to be the cook and now you're
Scrolling on your phone and now you're
Saying it tastes like styrofoam, what are you doing?

It keeps changing too much
What are you doing now
I can't keep up with it (WHA)
What are you doing now

What are you doing

I think I'm going crazy
My son spent one hour looking at a berry
In front of some guy named Terry
Who was laughing unsanitarily

And now he's pretending to fart, and saying
"I just farted again"
Which kinda makes me wanna crack up
But it's also kinda annoying
Because there are chores he's supposed to be doing

Oh my gosh, I can feel it rising up inside me
I can't push it down, it's rising up inside me
I feel I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy
I can't stop it, it's coming up inside me, AAAAA-

You spend one hour looking at a stationary object
And only 3 seconds on what you're supposed to be doing
What the heck is that sound, is that the sound of a siren?
Oh my gosh, what are you doing, Alex, it keeps changing so much
WHAT ARE YOU DOING

(I don't know what I'm doin', poo-poo)
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Suffer!
Suffer!
Yeah!
Suffer!

Suffer like you're in Gehenna
Suffer all the time
Suffer on June 11th
'Cause that's the suffer time

My pa's birthday's the day of suffer
'Cause he was meant to be a slave
'Cording to some random publisher
With a trademarked name

But anyway there's bills to pay
And I see a myriad of them
So do 'em all, 'cause that is
A primitive form of suffering, so

Suffer like you're in Gehenna
Oh, suffer all the time
So, suffer on June 11th, that day 'cause
That's the suffer time, it is

Hangin' up on bars, about
Fifty yards high, yeah
Get a shot of life-long scars
Livin' happy is a lie, yes

Suffer in the freezer
Or in Texas summer
Whichever one'll do 'cause of the
Extreme temperatures

Oh, yeah
Suffer!
Do it, suffer!
You gotta suffer!

Yo!
Suffer, Suffer!
Suffer!
S-U-F-F-E-R

In death, it's like you have to die and suffer to live
